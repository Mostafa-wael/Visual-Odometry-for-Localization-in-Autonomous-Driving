# Visual-Odometry-for-Localization-in-Autonomous-Driving
This is an assignment from "Visual Perception for Self-Driving Cars" course of the "Self-Driving Cars Specialization" on Coursera.org.

This assignmnet aims at estimating an autonmus vehicle trajectory by images taken with a monocular camera set up on the vehicle, throught 4 main tasks as follows:
- Extracting features from the photographs taken with a camera setup on the vehicle.
- Using the extracted features to find matches between the features in different photographs.
- Using the found matches to estimate the camera motion between subsequent photographs.
- Using the estimated camera motion to build the vehicle trajectory.
